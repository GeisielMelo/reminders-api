# reminders-api

This is the API responsible for managing the requested actions from the front-end of the Reminders application. In order for the application to function correctly, it is necessary to run both the backend and frontend simultaneously. You can find all the installation instructions on the main page of the application [Reminders](https://github.com/GeisielMelo/reminders) under the setup section.
